# Forkissan
Forkissan aims to bridge the technology gap in the agricultural sector and serve as a comprehensive platform for
learning farming techniques and meeting new technological farming-related needs.
## introduction
We identified that in the Agriculture sector, the farmers are still lacking the best Science and technology use cases. The reason for creating this app is to mitigate this gap and help farmers as possible. The farmers can use this app for disease detection and remedy recommendation, purchasing new and advanced farming machines for reducing the manpower required, and fertilizers and pesticides for better yield from farmland. Forkissan will also show the current market price of agricultural products and farmers can sell their agricultural products without any intermediary, directly to consumers.
